# Pandas

Pandas is a powerful and flexible open-source library in Python that’s widely used for data manipulation and analysis. It’s especially popular in data science, finance, and machine learning because of how easy it makes working with structured data.

Here’s an overview of what you can do with Pandas, along with some common functions to get you started.

Basics of Pandas
Pandas has two primary data structures:

Series: A one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type (e.g., integers, strings, floats).
DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a table or spreadsheet, where each column can be a different data type.

Pandas is highly flexible and integrates well with other libraries, so you can use it for a wide range of data tasks. Let me know if you'd like examples for a specific task or function!
